## Meet Thoth  

{#Thoth} (or more commonly Thoth) is a new, simple static blog generator written in Swift.   
Just write your articles in Markdown, put them in a directory, point Thoth to this directory, add a template, FTP settings and an output directory, and *voilÃ * !
Thoth will generate HTML pages for all articles, drafts, and index, and upload the output to your FTP. 

You can use it as a command-line tool :

	$ thoth scribe /path/to/your/blog/folder

or launch it as an application which will display its own prompt :

	./Thoth
	Welcome in {#THOTH}, a static blog generator.
	> scribe /path/to/your/blog/folder
	Export done !
	Uploading to FTP... Upload done !
	> _

##Install and setup
###Install
You can either download the installer package and execute it : Thoth will be installed in `/usr/local/bin`, or you can download the sources and compile it using Xcode.

###Setup
You can ask Thoth to create a folder containing a config file and all the needed directories by running the command `setup /path/to/the/future/blog/directory`.  

The config file is a plain text file, so you can create it yourself if you prefer (see the **Config file** section). In all cases, you must fill it before running other Thoth commands.  

When you want to generate and upload your site for the first time, use the `first /path/to/your/blog/folder` command.

##Writing
Each article markdown file should be put in the `articles` directory, and follow this header style :
	
	#The title
	32/12/2032
	The author (optional)
	
	The beginning of the article content starts here. Nullam id dolor id nibh ultricies vehica  
	ut id elit. Maecenas sed diam eget risus varius blandit sit amet non magna.
	
For drafts, just replace the date on the second line by the mention `draft`. Those files will be treated separately, and listed in an `index-drafts.html` file in the output.

Once you have finished writing your article, run the `scribe /path/to/blog/folder` command to automatically update the output and upload it. Do the same if you want to preview a draft online, or just call `generate /path/to/blog/folder` to generate it in the output folder.

## Functionalities

### Templates
Create your own HTML templates : Thoth expects at least two files in the template folder: index.html and article.html. All other files and folders will be also copied. Thoth uses a keywords system for inserting your articles content in the template you created or downloaded. Those keywords are simple and easy-to-use. You can use :

- `{#BLOG_TITLE}` to insert the blog title
- `{#TITLE}` to insert an article title
- `{#AUTHOR}` to insert the author name
- `{#DATE}` to insert the date of an article
- `{#LINK}` to insert a link to an article.
- `{#CONTENT}` to insert the content of an article
- `{#SUMMARY}` to insert a shortened version of an article (200-300 characters max.)
- `{#ARTICLE_BEGIN}` and `{#ARTICLE_END}` in the index.html template to delimitate the HTML corresponding to an article item in the list.

### Config file
A simple, human-readable config file. No XML, JSON or YAML. Just a simple flat text file, nothing more. It should be put at the root of your blog folder, along with `articles`, `template`, `output` folders. The current settings are :

- the path to the template folder (defaults to `rootPath/template`)  
`templatePath:		/custom/path/to/the/template/folder`

- the path to the articles folder containing the .md files (defaults to `rootPath/articles`)  
`articlesPath:		/custom/path/to/the/articles/folder`

- the path where Thoth should output the generated content (defaults to `rootPath/output`)  
`outputPath:		/custom/path/to/the/output/folder`

- the default author name to use on each article page (defaults to the current Mac user)  
`defaultAuthor:		Simon Rodriguez`

- the date style used in each article (in the .md file) (defaults to `MM/dd/yyyy`)  
`dateStyle:		dd/MM/YYYY`

- the title of the blog (defaults to "A new blog")  
`blogTitle:		My blog !`

- the default width for each image in articles html pages (defaults to `640`)  
`imageWidth:		640`

- set to true if you want each image of an article to link directly to the corresponding file (defaults to `false`)  
`imagesLinks:		true`

- the ftp address pointing to the exact folder where the output should be uploaded  
`ftpAdress:		domain-ftp.com/folder/for/blog`

- the ftp username  
`ftpUsername:	`	

- the ftp password (the best way is to create a specific user/password with restricted rights to access your FTP)  
`ftpPassword:	`	

- the ftp port to use (defaults to 21)  
`ftpPort:		21`




### Extended markdown parsing
You can create inline footnotes using the common format :

	[^ here's the content of my footnote]
	
Use the classes `footnote-link` and `footnote` in your template to style the footnotes links and content, respectively.

You can also easily manage your images size in markdown, either by setting a default width, or defining it using the following syntax : 

	![alt text](path/to/image.png "800,600,title")

or just 

	![alt text](path/to/image.png "800,title")

to automatically set the height according to the picture ratio.
Pictures from your articles which are stored on your computer are also retrieved by Thoth and copied in article-specific folders, for an easier management.

### Comments and ignored files
In the config file, lines beginning with a `#` or a `_` will be ignored.  
During articles processing and copy, files beginning with `_` or `#` won't be processed or copied.

##TODO:

- adding support for referenced footnotes
- adding the generation of sitemap.xml and feed.xml files
- more keywords and templates options
- better reliability of the `upload <path> -f` command
